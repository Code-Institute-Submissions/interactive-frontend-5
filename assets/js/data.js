                In the East people have condemned the body, condemned matter, called matter

                is made of the same stuff as dreams are made of. They denied the world, 
                and that is the reason for the East remaining poor, sick, in starvation.

                Half of humanity has been accepting the inner world but denying the outer 
                world. The other half of humanity has been accepting the material world and 
                denying the inner world. Both are half, and no man who is half can be contented. 
                You have to be whole: rich in the body, rich in science; rich in meditation, 
                rich in consciousness. Only a whole person is a holy person, according to me.

                I want Zorba and Buddha to meet together. Zorba alone is hollow. His dance has 
                not an eternal significance, it is momentary pleasure. Soon he will be tired of 
                it. Unless you have inexhaustible sources, available to you from the cosmos 
                itself...unless you become existential, you cannot become whole. This is my 
                contribution to humanity: the whole person.`,

                Knowledge is certain; the search for personal knowing is very, very hazardous. 
                Nobody can guarantee it. If you ask me if I can guarantee anything, I say 
                I cannot guarantee you anything. I can only guarantee danger, that much is
                certain. I can only guarantee you a long adventure with every possibility 
                of going astray and never reaching the goal. But one thing is certain: the 
                very search will help you to grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                I can guarantee only growth. Danger will be there, sacrifice will be there; 
                you will be moving every day into the unknown, into the uncharted, and 
                there will be no map to follow, no guide to follow. Yes, there are 
                millions of dangers and you can go astray and you can get lost, but 
                that is the only way one grows.

                Insecurity is the only way to grow, to face danger is the only way to grow,

                Loneliness is a negative state. You are feeling that it would have

                <br>
                To me, the capacity to doubt is one of the greatest blessings to humanity. 
                The religions have been enemies because they have been cutting the very roots 
                of doubt, and there is a reason why they have been doing that: because they 
                want people to believe in certain illusions that they have been preaching....

                existence - except your witnessing self, except your awareness - is just 
                ephemeral, made of the same stuff as dreams are made of? They are not 
                saying that these trees are not there. They are not saying that these 
                pillars are not there. Don't misunderstand because of the word "illusion".... 
                It has been translated as illusion, but illusion is not the right word.

                Illusion does not exist. Reality exists. Maya is just in between - it almost exists. 
                As far as day-to-day activities are concerned, it can be taken as reality. 
                Only in the ultimate sense, from the peak of your illumination, does it

                Your chaos is very ancient - for many, many lives you have been in chaos. 
                It is thick and dense. It is almost a universe in itself. So when you enter

                facing this danger nobody has ever become integrated, nobody has ever become

                <br>
                <br>
                Zen, or meditation, is the method which will help you to go through the chaos, 
                through the dark night of the soul, balanced, disciplined, alert. The dawn is 
                not far away, but before you can reach the dawn, the dark night has to be passed

                Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, 
                many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. 
                But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which 
                is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: 
                the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And 
                the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft 
                and dangers will be many.

                There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for 
                millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout 
                starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of 
                light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be 
                carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves.
                The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed.`,

                Not everybody can be a painter - and there is no need also. If everybody is a

                All the religions of the world have said God is the creator. I don't know 
                whether he is the creator or not, but one thing I know: the more creative you 
                become, the more godly you become. When your creativity comes to a climax, 
                when your whole life becomes creative, you live in God. So he must be the 
                creator because people who have been creative have been closest to him. Love

                When you listen, you become just a passage, a passivity, a receptivity,

                You cannot reach God as aggressive invaders, conquerors. 
                You can reach God only...or it will be better to say God can reach you

    description: `These three things are to be taken note of: the lowest love is sex 
                - it is physical - and the highest refinement of love is compassion. Sex is below love, 
                compassion is above love; love is exactly in the middle.
                Very few people know what love is. Ninety-nine percent of people, unfortunately, think sexuality is 
                love - it is not. Sexuality is very animal; it certainly has the potential of growing into love, 
                but it is not actual love, only a potential....
                <br>
                <br>
                If you become aware and alert, meditative, then sex can be transformed into love. And if your
                meditativeness becomes total, absolute, love can be transformed into compassion. Sex is the seed, 
                love is the flower, compassion is the fragrance.
                <br>
                <br>
                Buddha has defined compassion as love plus meditation. When your love is not just a 
                desire for the other, when your love is not only a need, when your love is a sharing, 
                when your love is not that of a beggar but an emperor, when your love is not asking 
                for something in return but is ready only to give - to give for the sheer joy of 
                giving - then add meditation to it and the pure fragrance is released. That is 
                compassion; compassion is the highest phenomenon.`,

                by the outside, and is not an idea -- and there is no experiment up to now 
                that has found any center in the brain which corresponds to awareness. The 
                whole work of meditation is to make you aware of all that is "mind" and 
                disidentify yourself from it. That very separation is the greatest 
                revolution that can happen to man.

                Now you can do and act on only that which makes you more joyous, 
                fulfills you, gives you contentment, makes your life a work of art, a 
                beauty. But this is possible only if the master in you is awake. Right 
                now the master is fast asleep. And the mind, the servant, is playing the 
                role of master. And the servant is created by the outside world, it

                Once your awareness becomes a flame, it burns up the whole slavery that the 
                mind has created. There is no blissfulness more precious than freedom,

                a tremendous force arises, a transformation of energy into light and love, 
                into greater life, into compassion, into creativity. It can take many forms. 
                But first you have to learn how to be at the source. Then the source will decide

                to be understood, not with your reasoning and intellectual mind but with 
                your loving heart. Or even just listening, not bothering whether it is 
                true or not. And a moment comes suddenly that you see it, which has been
